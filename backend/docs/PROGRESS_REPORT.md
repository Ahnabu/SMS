# School Management System - Progress Report

## Project Overview

Building a comprehensive multi-school management system where multiple schools can be registered under a single platform (e.g., school.com). Each school operates independently with its own users, data, and configurations while sharing the same codebase.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Super Admin Seeding System
**Status: Completed**

#### Features Implemented:
- **Automatic Seeding**: Creates superadmin user on database connection if none exists
- **Manual CLI Tools**: npm scripts for seeding operations
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable credentials via environment variables
- **Validation System**: Ensures essential users exist and are properly configured
- **Security**: Passwords are automatically hashed, prevents duplicate creation

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/app/utils/seeder.ts` - Core seeding functionality
- `src/app/scripts/seeder-cli.ts` - CLI tools for manual operations
- `src/app/DB/index.ts` - Enhanced database connection with seeding
- `src/server.ts` - Updated to use new database connection
- `src/app/config/index.ts` - Added superadmin configuration
- `backend/docs/SEEDING.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `backend/.env.example` - Environment template
- `backend/package.json` - Added seeding scripts

#### CLI Commands Available:
```bash
npm run seed seed              # Complete database seeding
npm run seed seed-superadmin   # Create superadmin only
npm run seed validate          # Validate seeding results
npm run seed reset-superadmin  # Reset superadmin credentials
npm run seed list-users        # List all system users
```

#### Default Credentials:
- Username: `superadmin` (configurable)
- Password: `super123` (configurable)
- Email: `superadmin@schoolmanagement.com` (configurable)

### 2. Enhanced School Management Models
**Status: Completed**

#### Features Implemented:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing Organization -> School structure

##### School Model (`school.model.ts`):
- **Auto-generation**: Unique school IDs, slugs, API endpoints, and keys
- **Enhanced Methods**: 20+ new methods for school operations
- **Academic Management**: Session creation and management
- **Statistics Updates**: Automated stats calculations
- **Search Capabilities**: Multi-field search functionality
- **Validation**: Comprehensive data validation
- **Indexing**: Optimized database performance

#### New School Capabilities:

2. **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Auto-generated slugs from school names
3. **API Integration**: Dynamic endpoints for face recognition apps
4. **Academic Flexibility**: Multiple academic sessions support
5. **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time performance metrics
6. **Search & Discovery**: Advanced school search capabilities
7. **Media Management**: Logo and image support
8. **Contact Management**: Structured contact information
9. **Settings Inheritance**: Default configurations with customization
10. **Status Workflow**: Approval workflow for new schools

## Current Architecture

### Database Structure
```
Users Collection (Enhanced)
├── Superadmin (platform owner)
├── School Admins (one per school)
├── Teachers (school-specific)
├── Students (school-specific)
├── Parents (school-specific)
└── Accountants (school-specific)

Schools Collection (Enhanced)
├── Basic Information (name, established year, etc.)
├── Contact Information (structured address, phone, email, etc.)
├── Administrative (status, admin assignment)
├── Academic Sessions (current and historical)
├── API Configuration (endpoints, keys)
├── Settings (grades, sections, policies)
├── Statistics (cached performance data)
└── Media (logo, images)

Organizations Collection (Legacy - Maintained)
└── Backward compatibility support
```

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Superadmin**: Platform owner, manages all schools
- **School Admin**: School owner, manages their institution
- **Teachers**: Subject-wise teaching and attendance
- **Students**: View grades, attendance, homework
- **Parents**: Monitor child's progress
- **Accountants**: Financial management (future)

### API Structure
- **Platform APIs**: `/api/v1/...` (existing)
- **Dynamic School APIs**: `/api/attendance/{school-slug}` (new)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role validation
- **School Isolation**: All data queries scoped by school

## Next Steps (In Progress)

### 3. Multi-School Authentication (In Progress)
- School-specific login pages
- Role-based access control
- JWT token school scoping
- Admin credential management

### Remaining Tasks:
4. **School-specific User Models**: Extend existing models
5. **Academic Calendar System**: Global calendar management
6. **Schedule Management**: Class timetables and periods
7. **Attendance System**: Dual attendance (face recognition + manual)
8. **Homework & Grading**: Assignment and evaluation system
9. **File Management**: Google Drive integration
10. **Dynamic API Endpoints**: Face recognition app integration

## Technical Specifications
