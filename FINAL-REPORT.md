## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. One-Time Fees Not Included in Total Paid Amount ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: After collecting payments with one-time fees, the `totalPaidAmount` only showed monthly payments, excluding one-time fees.

**Root Cause**: Pre-save hook in `studentFeeRecord.model.ts` only calculated from `monthlyPayments` array.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// backend/src/app/modules/fee/studentFeeRecord.model.ts (Lines 189-204)
const monthlyPaid = this.monthlyPayments.reduce(
  (sum, payment) => sum + payment.paidAmount, 0
);
const oneTimePaid = this.oneTimeFees?.reduce(
  (sum: number, fee: any) => sum + (fee.paidAmount || 0), 0
) || 0;
this.totalPaidAmount = monthlyPaid + oneTimePaid;
this.totalDueAmount = this.totalFeeAmount - this.totalPaidAmount;
```

**Impact**: Now correctly reflects all payments in student fee records.

---

### 2. Due Amount Calculation Incorrect ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Total due amount not properly calculated, especially when admission fees were involved.

**Root Cause**: Frontend and backend calculations were using database values that might be stale.

**Solution**: Added on-the-fly calculations in two backend services:

**`getStudentsByGradeSection`** (Lines ~895-920):
```typescript
// Calculate monthly paid
const monthlyPaid = feeRecord.monthlyPayments.reduce(
  (sum: number, payment: any) => sum + (payment.paidAmount || 0), 0
);
// Calculate one-time paid
const oneTimePaid = (feeRecord.oneTimeFees || []).reduce(
  (sum: number, fee: any) => sum + (fee.paidAmount || 0), 0
);
calculatedTotalPaid = monthlyPaid + oneTimePaid;
calculatedTotalDue = feeRecord.totalFeeAmount - calculatedTotalPaid;
```

**`getStudentFeeStatusDetailed`** (Lines ~1408-1435): Same calculation logic added.

**Frontend Update** (`AccountantFeeCollection.tsx` Lines 527-590):
```typescript
const calculatedTotalDue = 
  (detailedFeeStatus.monthlyDues || 0) + 
  (detailedFeeStatus.oneTimeDues || 0) + 
  (detailedFeeStatus.admissionPending 
    ? (detailedFeeStatus.admissionFeeAmount - (detailedFeeStatus.admissionFeePaid || 0)) 
    : 0);
```

**Impact**: All displays now show correct paid and due amounts across the system.

---

### 3. Financial Dashboard Crash ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bySeverity')`

**Root Cause**: Missing null checks for nested `defaultersData.summary.bySeverity`.

**Solution** (`FinancialDashboard.tsx` Lines 570-595):
```typescript
{defaultersData && defaultersData.summary && defaultersData.summary.bySeverity && (
  // Safe rendering with || 0 fallbacks
)}
```

**Impact**: Dashboard now loads without errors even with incomplete data.

---

### 4. dueDate Validation Error ✅ FIXED (Earlier)

**Issue**: "Path `dueDate` is required" for one-time fees.

**Solution**: Changed `oneTimeFees.dueDate` to `required: false` in schema.

**Impact**: Fee records create successfully without validation errors.
