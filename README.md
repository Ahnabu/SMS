## 🧪 Development Scripts

### Backend
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start            # Start production server
npm run seed         # Run database seeding scripts
```

### Frontend
```bash
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

## 📊 Database Seeding

Utility scripts in `backend/scripts/` for database operations:

```bash
# Check database contents
npx ts-node scripts/listActualData.ts

# Seed fee structures
npx ts-node scripts/seedFeeStructures.ts

# Check student data
npx ts-node scripts/checkStudents.ts

# Diagnose specific student
npx ts-node scripts/diagnoseStudent.ts
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "dueDate is required" error
- **Fixed**: dueDate now has a default value of 10
- Update existing fee structures to include dueDate field
- New structures automatically get dueDate = 10

### "No fee structure found" error
- Admin must create fee structure for the grade and academic year first
- Navigate to Admin Dashboard → Fee Management → Create Structure

### 400 Bad Request on fee endpoints
- **Fixed**: `includeLateFee` field added to validation schemas
- Restart backend server after pulling latest changes

### Student not found (404 errors)
- Ensure students are properly created with valid IDs
- Check database has students: `npx ts-node scripts/listActualData.ts`

### Frontend not connecting to backend
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env` matches backend URL
- Check backend server is running on correct port
- Verify CORS settings in backend
