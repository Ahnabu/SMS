## Date: October 4, 2025

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Accountant Module Structure
Created the following files in `backend/src/app/modules/accountant/`:

#### a. `accountant.interface.ts`
- Defined `IAccountant` interface with all necessary fields
- Added `IAccountantDocument`, `IAccountantMethods`, and `IAccountantModel` interfaces
- Created request/response interfaces: `ICreateAccountantRequest`, `IUpdateAccountantRequest`, `IAccountantResponse`
- Defined `IAccountantStats` for analytics
- Included photo management interfaces: `IAccountantPhoto`, `IAccountantPhotoDocument`

Key fields:
- Department: Finance, Payroll, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Budget Management, Financial Reporting, Audit, Tax, General Accounting
- Designation: Chief Financial Officer, Finance Manager, Chief Accountant, Senior Accountant, Accountant, Junior Accountant, Accounts Assistant, Payroll Officer, Financial Analyst, Auditor
- Responsibilities and Certifications arrays
- Experience tracking similar to teachers

#### b. `accountant.model.ts`
- Created Mongoose schemas for Accountant and AccountantPhoto
- Implemented instance methods: `generateAccountantId()`, `getAgeInYears()`, `getFullName()`, `getFolderPath()`, `canUploadMorePhotos()`, `getTotalExperience()`, `getNetSalary()`
- Implemented static methods: `findBySchool()`, `findByDepartment()`, `findByAccountantId()`, `generateNextAccountantId()`
- Added pre-save middleware for ID generation and salary calculation
- Added pre-delete middleware for photo cleanup
- Configured virtuals for photos and photo count
- Set up proper indexing for performance

ID Format: `SCH001-ACC-YYYY-XXX` (e.g., `SCH001-ACC-2025-001`)

#### c. `accountant.validation.ts`
- Created Zod validation schemas for all routes:
  - `createAccountantValidationSchema`
  - `updateAccountantValidationSchema`
  - `getAccountantValidationSchema`
  - `deleteAccountantValidationSchema`
  - `getAccountantsValidationSchema`
  - `uploadPhotosValidationSchema`
  - `deletePhotoValidationSchema`
  - `getAccountantsByDepartmentSchema`
  - `getAccountantsStatsValidationSchema`

- Validates age (21-65 years)
- Validates qualifications (at least 1 required)
- Validates experience (0-45 years)
- Validates department and designation enums
- Validates address format

#### d. `accountant.service.ts`
- Implemented `createAccountant()` with:
  - School verification
  - Unique ID generation
  - User account creation
  - Photo folder setup
  - Photo upload handling
  - Transaction management
  - Credential generation

- Implemented `getAccountants()` with:
  - Filtering by department, designation, active status
  - Search functionality
  - Pagination support
  - Sorting capabilities

- Implemented `getAccountantById()` with full population
- Implemented `updateAccountant()` with transaction safety
- Implemented `deleteAccountant()` with cascade deletion
- Implemented `getAccountantStats()` for analytics

#### e. `accountant.controller.ts`
- Created controllers for all CRUD operations
- Implemented credential management endpoints
- Added proper error handling
- Integrated with auth middleware for school-based filtering

Endpoints:
- `POST /accountants` - Create accountant
- `GET /accountants` - Get all accountants (with filters)
- `GET /accountants/stats/:schoolId` - Get statistics
- `GET /accountants/:id` - Get accountant by ID
- `PATCH /accountants/:id` - Update accountant
- `DELETE /accountants/:id` - Delete accountant
- `GET /accountants/:accountantId/credentials` - Get credentials
- `POST /accountants/:accountantId/credentials/reset` - Reset password

#### f. `accountant.route.ts`
- Configured Express router with multer for file uploads
- Applied authentication and authorization middleware
- Set up validation middleware
- Configured routes for CRUD operations and credential management

#### g. `accountant.credentials.service.ts`
- Implemented `generateAccountantCredentials()` - Generate username/password
- Implemented `saveAccountantCredentials()` - Store credential metadata
- Implemented `getAccountantCredentials()` - Retrieve credentials for admin
- Implemented `resetAccountantPassword()` - Reset to default password
- Implemented `getSchoolAccountantsCredentials()` - Get all school accountant credentials

Default credentials:
- Username: accountant ID without hyphens (e.g., `sch001acc2025001`)
- Password: accountant ID with random suffix (e.g., `SCH001-ACC-2025-001-A3F9`)

### 2. Utility Updates

#### a. `credentialGenerator.ts`
Added two new static methods to the `CredentialGenerator` class:

```typescript
static async generateUniqueAccountantId(
  joiningYear: number,
  schoolId: string,
  designation?: string
): Promise<{
  accountantId: string;
  employeeId: string;
  sequenceNumber: number;
}>
```
- Generates unique accountant IDs following the pattern: `SCH001-ACC-YYYY-XXX`
- Generates employee IDs: `SCH001-EMP-ACC-YYYY-XXX`
- Ensures uniqueness through database checks
- Sequential numbering per year and school

```typescript
static async generateAccountantCredentials(
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  accountantId: string
): Promise<GeneratedCredentials>
```
- Generates unique usernames from accountant ID
- Creates secure passwords with random suffix
- Hashes passwords with bcrypt
- Marks credentials as requiring password change

#### b. `fileUtils.ts`
Added method for accountant photo folder management:

```typescript
static async createAccountantPhotoFolder(
  schoolName: string,
  accountantInfo: {
    firstName: string;
    age: number;
    bloodGroup: string;
    joinDate: string;
    accountantId: string;
  }
): Promise<string>
```
- Creates folder structure: `storage/{schoolName}/Accountants/accountant@{firstName}@{age}@{bloodGroup}@{joinDate}@{accountantId}`
- Returns relative path for database storage

### 3. Middleware

#### `parseAccountantData.ts`
- Parses JSON fields from FormData
- Handles type conversions (strings to numbers/booleans)
- Processes nested objects (qualifications, experience, salary, etc.)
- Ensures data consistency before validation

### 4. Route Integration

Updated `backend/src/app/routes/index.ts`:
- Added import for `AccountantRoutes`
- Registered route: `{ path: "/accountants", route: AccountantRoutes }`

---

## Frontend Implementation

getAccountants: (params?: {
  page?: number;
  limit?: number;
  department?: string;

## Notes

1. The accountant module follows the exact same pattern as the teacher module for consistency
2. All operations are school-scoped for multi-tenancy support
3. Transaction management ensures data integrity
4. Photo management uses the same infrastructure as teachers and students
5. Credentials are automatically generated and can be reset by administrators
6. The system supports up to 999 accountants per school per year (sequence 001-999)

---

## Compatibility

- ✅ Backend: Fully implemented and tested
- ✅ API: All endpoints functional
- ⚠️ Frontend: List component implemented, form components pending
- ✅ Database: Schema and indexes configured
- ✅ Authentication: Integrated with existing auth system
- ✅ File Upload: Integrated with existing file system

---

## Conclusion

The accountant management system has been successfully implemented with full CRUD functionality, credential management, photo upload support, and analytics. The backend is complete and ready for production use. The frontend requires additional components (form, detail view, etc.) to provide a complete user experience.

The implementation maintains consistency with the existing teacher management system and follows the established patterns and best practices of the SMS project.
